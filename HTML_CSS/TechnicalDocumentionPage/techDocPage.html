                Road cycling is the most widespread form of cycling in which cyclists ride on paved roadways. 
                Road bicycle frame materials and groupsets are continuously changing to take advantage of the lightest, and highest-performing materials 
                to give cyclists any possible advantage over their competitors in these tightly contested races.

            <p>
                Bike frames have been made from a variety of different materials over the years, with steel originally dominating. 
                Now the major choice is between aluminium and carbon fibre, although steel and titanium still feature commonly.
            </p>
            <h4>Steel</h4>
            <p>
                Steel frames are often built using various types of steel alloys including chromoly. 
                They are strong, easy to work, and relatively inexpensive. However, they are denser (and thus generally heavier) 
                than many other structural materials. Compared to aluminum-based frames, steel frames generally offer a smoother 
                riding experience.
            </p>
            <h4>Aluminum</h4>
            <p>
                Aluminum alloys have a lower density and lower strength compared with steel alloys; however, 
                they possess a better strength-to-weight ratio, giving them notable weight advantages over steel. 
                Early aluminum structures have shown to be more vulnerable to fatigue, either due to ineffective alloys, 
                or imperfect welding technique being used. This contrasts with some steel and titanium alloys, 
                which have clear fatigue limits and are easier to weld or braze together.
            </p>
            <h4>Carbon</h4>
            <p>
                Carbon fiber composite is a popular non-metallic material commonly used for bicycle frames. 
                Although expensive, it is light-weight, corrosion-resistant and strong, and can be formed into almost any shape desired. 
                The result is a frame that can be fine-tuned for specific strength where it is needed (to withstand pedaling forces), 
                while allowing flexibility in other frame sections (for comfort). Custom carbon fiber bicycle frames may even be designed 
                with individual tubes that are strong in one direction (such as laterally), while compliant in another direction 
                (such as vertically).
            </p>
            <h4>Titanium</h4>
            <p>
                Titanium is a relatively niche material for bicycle frames. It has many desirable characteristics, 
                including a high specific strength, high fatigue limit, and excellent corrosion resistance. 
                While not as light as carbon fiber frames, titanium's properties and reasonable stiffness lend to a more pleasant ride quality, 
                making the material popular among cyclists seeking comfort over performance. 
                However, titanium has a high material cost and is more difficult to machine than steel or aluminum, 
                which translates to relatively expensive frames compared to steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber.

                A groupset comprises all the mechanical parts for your bike - so basically everything except the frame, fork, 
                wheels, handlebar, seatpost and saddle.

                Professional racing originated in Western Europe, centred in France, Spain, Italy amd the Low Countries.
                Since the mid-1980s, the sport has diversified, whith races held at the professional, semi-professional, and ameteur levels, worldwide.
                The sport is governed by the Union Cycilste Internationale (UCI).
